_That's It?_

The idea is to create a self balancing robot, which should learn to balance itself without explicitly coding in the logic to do so.
In a traditional sense we need to apply reinforcement learning model to let the robot train itself.
Instead of going into the details of how that can be accomplished, here I lay down the foundations of the hardware setup required to achieve this.

### General Hardware Overview
On a high level we have the following:
* **Micro-controller** - Orchestrate input from different sensors and drive the motors appropriately.
* **Gyroscope** - Sensor informing about the tilt angle of the robot.
* **Stepper Motor** - Precisely control the movement of the robot.

The diagram below shows a schematic connection of how different components can be connected together:
