## Simple Instructions
By default the VNC resolution is not apt. To change it, you can specify configuration in your Raspberry Pi, so that the VNC Viewer will start rendering in that.

To change the resolution do the following in a Terminal running on your Pi (either through ssh or VNC):
* ```sudo vim /boot/config.txt```
* Then add the following below the ```# uncomment to force a specific HDMI mode (this will force VGA)``` line:
	```
	hdmi_ignore_edid=0xa5000080
	hdmi_group=2
	hdmi_mode=85
	```
