## Getting Started in Headless Mode

In headless mode, you are using your wifi enabled Raspberry Pi (Zero 2 W, in this case) without a screen. You will need to ssh into your raspberry pi to start using it. To get started with this you have to:
* Include a blank file named "ssh" at the root of your pi's sd card (i.e. boot drive). This tells the pi to allow ssh connection at startup.
* Include a "wpa_supplicant.conf" to provide your wifi network's credentials. This should be a 2.4GHz network to begin with. You can later update the firmware to connect with 5GHz networks. The contents of the file should be like:
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
	ssid="network_name"
	psk="network_password"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```
* Ideally if your master computer is on the same network as the pi, then you can try issuing the command ```ping raspberrypi``` to check if the configuration is working. Or find the devicename ```raspberrypi``` in your router's connection list.
* SSH into your pi using ```ssh pi@raspberrypi``` with default password as ```raspberry```.

Now you have access to your pi.

### General Post Connection Steps
* Update password: ```passwd```. Alternatively use ```raspi-config```. I've updated password using my general algorithm.
* (Optional) Elevate your user to super user: ```sudo su -```. 
* Update and upgrade debian packages: ```apt-get update && apt-get upgrade```. This updates the list of packages available and then upgrades the packages in one go.
* Enable VNC (Virtual Network Computing): To use GUI from pi via vnc protocol. Simply go to ```raspi-config``` then navigate to: Interface Options > VNC and enable it.
  * Download a VNC client for your OS. I've used [VNC Viewer from RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)
  * Get your pi's ip address on your wifi network. You can either obtain it from your router's admin panel. Or simply type ```ifconfig``` in your pi (as connected via ssh). Then look at wlan0 > inet.
  * In VNC Viewer simply enter this ip address to connect.

* Shutdown: ```shutdown -h now``` or ```poweroff```


## Issues Getting Started

While trying to start the pi in headless mode one can face certain issues. Below are some issues I faced and solution to get things working.

* _Blinking LED_: After boot if the LED is still blinking, it could be attributed to power supply. Simply try using a different adapter if not using the official one (as in my case)
* _Unable to connect to ssh_: From wpa_supplicant.conf you can see that you specified key_mgmt as WPA-PSK. Check in your routers admin panel if your router's key management is done via this. For my case it was WPA2-PSK, and updating the wpa_supplicant.conf didn't worked. So, I simply changed the router's key management to "WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK". Go into the router's admin panel to do so.
* _Unable to ping raspberrypi_: If you don't get any response for ```ping raspberrypi```, then you can try obtaining the ip address of the pi using your routers admin panel. You can then type ```ping your_ip_address``` (which for my case was ```ping 192.168.1.22```) to check if the connection is working.
