_Guess I should take a break!_

When it comes to Triathlon it adds trice the efforts, maintainance and expenses when compared to an individual sport. 
And when it comes to performance improvements, Triatheletes are infamout for being the most irrational spenders even for marginal gains.
Knowing myself being a safe buyer (safe on product, not on money), I tried to be very frugal and not have another needless hole in my pocket (gaming being the first one - I technically have every major gaming console and a bunch of "unopened" game boxes!!)

Just reflecting back I realize despite being careful, I've already spent a handsome sum on tracking my Triathlon ambitions.
I believe this post is going to be a WIP and I'll update as keep throwing more coins down the performance well.
Below I am only including essentials for my Triathlon preperation. Any accessories not necessary haven't been included.

## Closing Thoughts
I guess despite trying to be frugal, I still keep up with the tradition!
Weather or not this was worth it completely depends on my knee recovery :P!! 

But jokes aside, I believe pushing yourself beyond what you thought was possible flows into every aspect of your life. If you ever feel like something is impossible, break it down to bite sized possibilities and you'll learn to open your mouth wider!!!

Barely being able to run for a couple of miles, having never tried my endurance on bike and being out of breath within 50m swim just 3 months ago, I can say I have come a long way!!
